# Fiction Engine
Fiction Engine is a game engine developed by Sahne DÃ¼nya! It aims to be a robust alternative to Unreal Engine! It's designed specifically for photorealistic graphics, AAA (big-budget) games, and advanced simulations. Fiction Engine's core is written in Classic C, making it simpler and more powerful than Unreal Engine's C++! Instead of coding, it offers Blueprints, a visually-based programming tool that allows you to create game logic without writing code. However, knowledge of C programming is required, and even with C++, there's a clear difference! Blueprints is quite powerful, but it still has its challenges. While it can be difficult to use, it will deliver better results! It's also a general-purpose game engine, with cross-platform support! While this game engine only supports C in its initial releases, support for C++ and Objective-C may be added in the future! However, this game engine's native language is Classic C! The engine's own libraries include Memory, making it possible to manage both ownership and borrowing memory in both C/C++ and Objective-C! It uses a unique physics engine similar to Chaos Physics! This makes games more realistic!
