# Fiction Engine
* Fiction Engine, developed by Sahne Dünya, is a legendary game engine and an alternative to Unreal Engine. It aims to replace Unreal Engine in high-graphics gaming, boasting its own physics engine, rendering engine, DynamicR (a real-time dynamic global illumination and reflection system), and GeometryV (a virtualized geometry system). Those familiar with Unreal Engine will understand its serious potential as an alternative. While the initial version only supports OpenGL, it can support other APIs in the future with your input. Also, while the initial version only supports Unix and Windows, export options for other operating systems may be added later! It is also open-source software.
